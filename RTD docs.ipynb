    "## Parallelization and memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The cython version of the RTD approach is fully prepared for parallelization using OpenMP, meaning that the program currently does not run in parallel, but changing that requires only modifying a handful lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the parallelization is that the kernels can be build row by row or column by column (and sometimes element by element, but that is not used). Therefore, each parallel thread can build e.g. a row in a kernel by calling for example `ApproachRTD.generate_row_1st_order_kernel()`. The number of threads $p_t$ used by the program (in the future) is $p_t=\\min(p_{max}, N)$ where $N$ is the number of many body states and $p_{max}$ is maximum the number of logical cores of the processor. When building $W_{dn}$ and $L_{nn}$ the number of threads is instead $p_{t,o}=\\min(p_{max}, N')$ where $N'$ is the number of off-diagonal elements included in the calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to parallelization works fine for all kernels except $W_{dd}^{(2)}$ since the usage the of symmetries in Eqs. \\ref{Eq:W2symmetries1}-\\ref{Eq:W2symmetries4} means that each call to `ApproachRTD.generate_col_diag_kern_2nd_order()` can modify up to four columns, which can lead to race conditions. As a solution to this problem, all threads have their own copy of $W_{dd}^{(2)}$, and the result is reduced (summed) after all threads are done with their work. $W_{dd}^{(2)}$ is thus stored in a numpy array of size $p_t \\times N_{leads} \\times N \\times N$. The first slice of this is later used to store the full $W_{dd} = W_{dd}^{(2)}[0,:,:,:]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving each thread access to its own $N_{leads} \\times N \\times N$ array of course increases memory consumption, but it increases execution speed as the symmetries can be used. Besides, second oder approaches are more computationally heavy than first order approaches and are thus normally used for smaller system sizes where memory is not a problem.\n",

    "This means that memory required scales worse with number of single particle states $n$ than in the Pauli approach, but typically better than the other first order approaches. As an exmaple, using 8 threads the memory consumption scales rougly the same as the 1vN approach when using the $S^2$ symmetry (see Fig. 9 in the QmeQ paper [(8)](#refs)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the python implementation parallelization is not intended to be used, and thus $p_t=1$. Furthermore, the last term in the memory equation then reads $(N')^2$ due to that code not being as optimized.\n",
